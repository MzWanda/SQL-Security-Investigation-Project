# SQL-Security-Investigation-Project

## Obejective

The objective of the SQL Security Investigation Project is to demonstrate the ability to leverage SQL queries to investigate and identify security vulnerabilities within a database. The project involves analyzing system logs, identifying suspicious patterns, and extracting valuable insights to detect unauthorized access and data breaches. The goal is to enhance data protection by providing actionable intelligence for cybersecurity professionals to mitigate risks and secure systems from potential threats.

## Skills Learned
Advanced SQL Querying
Gained proficiency in writing complex SQL queries to extract, filter, and analyze large datasets for potential security incidents and anomalies.

Data Analysis for Security
Developed the ability to analyze logs and database records to identify patterns indicative of security breaches or unauthorized access.

Security Incident Detection
Learned how to detect suspicious activities and potential vulnerabilities within databases, including unauthorized data modifications and access attempts.

Log Analysis
Enhanced skills in interpreting system and database logs to track user activities, identify discrepancies, and uncover security threats.

Vulnerability Identification
Gained hands-on experience in identifying security risks and weaknesses within databases that could be exploited by malicious actors.

Threat Mitigation Recommendations
Learned to formulate actionable recommendations for mitigating detected security risks, such as access controls and data encryption practices.
## Tools Used
SQL (Structured Query Language)
Utilized SQL to write queries for data extraction, analysis, and investigation of system logs and database records to identify security vulnerabilities.

MySQL / PostgreSQL
Used MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database management systems to implement, test, and execute SQL queries, ensuring efficient data handling and security checks.

SQLite
Employed SQLite for lightweight, local database instances to simulate different security scenarios and execute queries without requiring a full database server.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Leveraged SSMS to manage SQL Server databases, run queries, and analyze data for potential security issues in a structured and intuitive environment.

Wireshark
In some cases, used Wireshark for network traffic analysis to correlate database access events with network activity and detect anomalies that might indicate security breaches.
